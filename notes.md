# Week 7: Notes

- Raise the Dead I: ABM
  - "	it	is	crucial	to	realise	that	in	actual	research	of	the	topic	such	hypotheses	would	emerge through literature review and data analysis" --> "The	results	of	formal	computational	modelling	studies	of	such	hypotheses	will	always	need	to	be	reinserted	into	these	substantive	debates,	otherwise	we	are	just	making	computational	models	for	the	sake	of	it"
  - "Check	what	procedures are	included	and	how	they	work,	identify	which	procedures	you	need	to	copy	and	check	that	there	are	no	errors,	explore	how	this	code	will	need	to	be	modified	to	work	for	your current	purposes." --> I feel like language is too general and might confuse someone new to this
  - Very cute model
  - Just used "setup" command in command line tool
  - The future of these technologies directly ties in with their usability
  - Wow adding things to the interface is... not intuitive
    - Struggling to comprehend the meaning behind the activity --> getting lost in trying to figure out how to actually use the tool and struggling to remember what I've already learned
  - Okay... I am wrapping up this activity unfinished --> *might* come back later
    - NetLogo feels like VB but worse --> is there such thing as TOO user friendly?
    - I feel like I've never programmed in my life using this software
    - Constant switching between interface and code caused confusion for me --> would make small errors because of the "divide" between interface and code
    - Felt like code was disconnected from interface in the sense that you had to manually add the control elements on the interface rather than the code creating these elements
    - Frustrating/tedious experience --> surely there is another way to do ABM?


- Raise the Dead II: GPT-2
  - I love how accessible colab can make computing work
  - Check point text developing into sentences that could be believeable if you had no idea who Lanciani is --> has this ever been used to falsify information?
  - "It’ll start predicting likely text from the seed “LORD” (the demo was trained on the plays of Shakespeare, so ‘LORD’ is a cue for a character to start speaking). Change that word to something like, “Why were the early Christians a threat to Roman power?”"
    - Contrast made me laugh
    - How sensical is output when prefix is one word versus full question?
      - Putting all output in one text file for convinience
      - "Ritual"
        - Got an interpretive hymn about "Ritual of Dedication" --> very creative
        - The "Ritual of the immolation of the body" is offered on the 19th of September
          - Sad to have missed it
        - Single word seems to produce... **odd** results --> maybe questions may yield better results because more "content" to work with
      - "What ties does the cemetery have to the spiritual?"
        - Much more logical (?) results --> kind of sounds like someone who doesn't quite know the answer to a question trying to answer the question
      - Asked "Will I ever be able to afford a house in our current economy?" for fun and to get Lanciani's hot take
        - I've immediately been typed as a worried farmer
        - Last response mentions someone receiving an e-mail in 1817
          - Flaws can result from the text you use --> the only time e-mail is mentioned in the text is in the full license statement not apart of Lanciani's work

- Quotes
  - "However, as we find ourselves using digital devices that transcend our own abilities and which in some instances create the phenomena that we are seeking to record, when devices operate in ways we do not fully understand, and when designers seek to make devices more 'user-friendly' and in the process disguise their mode of operation, it becomes all the more important to investigate the role of cognitive artefacts within archaeology and the relationships and dependencies that exist within the digital ecosystem we are creating." -Huggett
  - "I often run my hands over features as I set up tapes—I am “up close and personal” with the site and its features. In addition to the excavators, supervisors,  and  directors,  the  surveyor  can  be  another  pair  of  eyes  on  the  ground,  but  I  acknowledge  that  so  too  can  a  drone  be  an  “eye  in  the  sky.”" -Kersel
  - "We  are carrying out more comprehensive archaeology (or what Olson and colleagues  (2013)  labeled  “total  archaeology”)  and  leading  a  digital  life,  but  I  worry  that  in  our  preoccupation  with  a  paperless  life  we  might overlook the legacy of paper and a closer connection to the site." -Kersel
