Prefix: "Ritual"

Ritual of Dedication, in
the form of a Latin hymn:--

O FUCTUS URBIS

[Symbol: -X]

Translation:

O build, O make

[Symbol: -X]

Linguistic and historical reasons explain the origin of the
custom. The _mundus muliebris_, or memorial wall, by which
the remains of temples, altars, and tombs
were buried, and the _ustrinum_, or sacred enclosure for the
burial of the temple or altar, on which the ashes were
kept until the next temple was built, or when the
utensils were used to carry the grave away, or when
the corpse was moved from one place to another. The
_ustrinum_ was an important place, especially in the
nineteenth century, when the number of temples and tombs
created by the building of new or reconstructed temples
was great. According to Ersilia Lovatelli, who
published a work on the subject in vol. i., p. 297, in the
_Annali della società romana di Roma_, 1889
====================
Ritual and ceremony have passed away; we are in the true
possession of the old ruins, with which the Campagna is
integrated with the Val d'Inferno and the Via Salaria, and
with the help of the "levellers" of antiquities, whose reports and
discoveries are published in the "Digest of an Empire" (London, Allen,
1885), no longer need be accepted as conclusive, or even interesting,
subjects. They are served by a cavalcade of "modern"
edifices, from the Viceroy of Morocco, to the present
president of the United States, and from the Baron de
Ambrose, head of a French diplomatic mission, to the Duc d'
Antonin.

The altar is described as one of the finest in the Campagna,
and one of the best preserved in the world. It was built
by the _Campagna Templi_, _ad pastoris_, at the time of
Urban VI., before the barrows of Çalanders. The altar
is described as one of the finest examples of Christian
ecorasonry discovered in Rome. It was originally composed
of two elements, one of which was dedicated to Constantine,
or, more correctly, to the name of the prince who had raised
the temple, "Albo dinero," and the other to Aius Locutius,

Ritual of
immolation and profanation marked the spot where the
old city walls once met. That the grave had once contained
an offering worthy of allusion to this question is proved not only by
the date and quality of the inscriptions, but also by the
sketches made at the time of the discovery. The best
result is obtained when the offering is removed to the
Old Vicolo dei Fiorentini, where it was found in 1871 to be
consisting, as the inscription says, of ointments
and libations, "of oak and myrtle, offered in commemoration
of the sixtieth anniversary banquet." The offering is described as a
granite tablet, with an inscription carved on the side
above the portrait of the Emperor Constantine. The granite tablet
is divided into panels by number, and the number plate is
engraved on the opposite side. The first panel corresponds
to the plate of the imperial banquet, the inscription above
the plate. The inscription is very much like that found in 1871, except
that instead of referring to the banquet as a whole, it
speaks of the anniversary as a _grande necessario

What ties does the cemetery have to the spiritual?

The cemetery is characterised by a strong religious association,
even when distant from the church of S. Silvestro al Quirinale.
This association is so strong that, in case of death, the
cubicula of the cemetery are asked to light a candle before the
deceased's tomb; and, if possible, to light the same before the
wedding of the bride and bridegroom. As a rule, the deceased
believes in the supernatural but does not wish to appear
false to his children or the dead. In case of a marriage
failure, the deceased's will is known by a signature, which
is usually given to the bride and bridegroom, or if possible to the
household. The cemetery is divided into
periods by the calendar name of the year in which the
marriage was solemnised, and by the month and day of the week. Each
period corresponds exactly to the days of the week beginning with the
"fecundis," and ending with the Gregorian. In Rome, at the beginning
of the fourth century, there were eleven
calendar months, and in Rome, at the beginning of the

What ties does the cemetery have to the spiritual?

One of the best-known remains of the Via Salaria, which connects the Via
Ardeatina, the main artery of the city, with the Vatican,
is no doubt the tomb of the sister of Faustina and Cornelius,
or at least that is the opinion of many contemporary writers. There are two
ivories in the ground near the tomb of S. Peter, one of them
covered with a layer of earth, stone, and chips of marble, which
fall into the groove of the columns, and are buried in the
corner of the _aræ componditæ_. The other, which is uncovered
and near the top of the column, contains a _toga_, or
bowl, made of rough stones. Whoever is to blame for the
catacombs, whoever dug them, whoever opened them and
concealed them from view, they may be right in their
judgements. I shall select from each of the three vaults,
consisting of one or two layers of earth, one or two
capitals, of marble, which I have found in other cemeteries,
sometimes in the excavations of which I have spoken

What ties does the cemetery have to the spiritual? The burial-grounds, the tombs, the
cubiculi, the bas-reliefs, the ixodophoroi, the picture-heads, the
graffiti, the _llama-sheds_, the _cubiculi_, the
columns of S. Peter, the _cubicula_, the
rows of S. Paul's, the _xerxes_, the
rows of S. Peter's, the house of the martyrs, and
the rest of the Roman remains in the Via Latina.

The cemetery is divided into layers by
means of projecting pilasters, which are supported by thin
pieces of travertine. The first layer is composed
of two or three obelisks, some of which are still in their
original positions, some have been moved several times. The
totality of the monuments is now exhibited in one
century of mosaic in the "cubicula" of the "locus Iniciana."

The skeletons are arranged in columns, the skeletons being
preferred over the original row of six by six. The

What ties does the cemetery have to the spiritual?

The cemeteries of SS. Giovanni e Paolo and S. Paul have a long and rich tradition,
both in the cemetery and in their connection with the city. One of them, called
Cimiterio Neroniani, or the Cemetery of the Nestorians, was the
place where the episcopal chair was laid out in 1545, during the
pontificate of John VIII., when "the last remains of the apostolic
line were buried in the hill above the cemetery." The coffin was
given the name of Comte della Minerva, and its first owner,
Commodus, the Cæsar of old, who built the Portico of the
Nestorians, and the basilica of Constantine, both of which
are still in existence. The tomb is described as a "square sepulchre, built
of solid marble." It was first explored in the spring of 1883, when the
Excavation and Quarries Commission, under the chairmanship of MR
W. H. DE V. PAOLO (widening the question to include the
Cimiterio Neroniani and the Cemetery of the Nestorians), reported to

What ties does the cemetery have to the spiritual? According to Pliny,
_a cemetery for the burial of souls who have committed
no crime._ When the Via Cornelia was built, and the cemetery
allowed for the better part of a mile around it, there was
not an unholy grave to be found. The ungodly were buried in
the old lyceum or at the foot of the steps of the
uniculus, which was built expressly to receive them. The
_graves_ were described by Pliny as having been
covered with a glutinous substance, like honeycombed with
calamities, and excavated in such quantities that no
body could read them. The best description of the dig at
the time given by Tacitus is that of a town, new-crowned
(after the fall of Hadrian) in the midst of a wilderness,
enclosed with walls made of travertine. There was a
hill above the town, on which a tall tower was erected, on
the basis of a design by Lante. It soon became evident that the
taller tower was a mistake, because we find written
on it, quote after quote from Pliny, "_ad duas met

Will I ever be able to afford a house in our current economy? When will I be able to buy a farm in the
fashion in which modern conveniences are put up? The house at the corner of the
Casa della Consolata and the estate of the Medici, now owned by
the city council, were built by the Medici in the time of Sixtus IV.,
and are directly descended from his Gothic ruins. The only difference
is that in the Middle Ages we had to go to Rome to buy our
frescoes, whereas in the Renaissance we could see them in Florence.

ninety-two thousand sestertii; it is not sufficient to provide for my

necessity of saving for a house in order to buy one on the high-road

Will I ever be able to afford a house in our current economy?

I cannot help thinking that, in some ways, the answer is in favor of the landlord.
When land was cheap, and the tenant was obliged to sell his or her
house at a loss, the landlord might be thought to have reduced
the cost of living by giving his house to the tenant at a
discount. He was, however, in a position to do so; and the
rent was high, since the landowner owned many adjoining
properties, which were used as grazing or pastures for bulls or
buffaloes. It is true that the term "buffaloe" is not always
used in a negative sense; it can mean both cattle and
buffaloes, as in the case of the Villa Madama, of which we
have an account
(p. 60). The Villa Madama is still in existence, although it
has been destroyed by the fire of 1710. Its site and surroundings
are now shown by a large scar which marks the spot.

employed on a piece by piece basis, each member of which was
paid his share as follows:--
====================
Will I ever be able to afford a house in our current economy?

I dare say not. I believe, however, that the building of the new house, the
transformation of the old one into a house of great honor, and of
modern luxury, was done for the benefit of the poor, not for the
self-supporting life of the aristocracy. The building of the
house was financed by a certain Jacobacci, a friend and
advisor of the empress; and as the house stood on the spot of
the triumphal arch, where it was perceived that many poor
folks had walked in darkness, and up to the highest walls of the
city, to gather wood, and light a fire, the building was
done in haste, on favorable and unsuspecting conditions. The
house is built on the left side by a large group of wealthy
apothecaries, and its main hall is named the _Chiese_ (from the name of
the club), while the nave and the choir were named after
the owner of the factory, or his employees. The school is a
_choira civium_, or gathering of the wealthy in honoraria, while

I received the following e-mail, written on February 22, 1817:

"[Anna Maria] Cæsar was born at Nemi, August 9, A. D. 71. She died in her family home at Nemi, August 19,
A. D. The family tomb, discovered by accident under the Monte del
Grano, was opened, as usual, on Friday, July 7, 1816. I
found myself at the head of a small party, led by my
arch-deacon, Gianni Alexandro. We were told to go and fetch the
body in a coffin of solid bronze. We set off early in the morning
of Saturday, July 8, bound for Rome. The journey was difficult,
because the coffin must have been dug several times, to a depth
of at least twenty-five feet. Fortunately, I remember my
